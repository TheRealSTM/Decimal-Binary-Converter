# Decimal-Binary-Converter
The original idea came from [here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas).

The simple app allows users to provide a decimal value and it is converted into binary value, which is displayed on the screen.

The app is intended to be a quick project to act as a quick refresher of basic html/css/js.

The converter can be accessed [here](https://therealstm.github.io/Decimal-Binary-Converter/decimalToBinaryConverter.html).
